Dear Sir/Madam,

I, Sanjaykumar Patil, have applied for USA visitor B1/B2 visa with application number AA005RV6WS and had an interview on 18th of April, 2016. During interview the consular officer told me that student visa is appropriate for my purpose of visit.
However, my situation has changed. My purpose of travel to United States is to attend a week long scientific meeting in July, 2016. Please find the attached document supporting my claim for visitor visa and reconsider my application.

Thank you,
